To convert the JSON format to the desired schema, you can use the `json` and `geojson` modules in Python. Here's an example of how you could create such a module:
```python
import json
from geojson import Feature, FeatureCollection, Polygon

def convert_to_feature_collection(json_data):
    data = json.loads(json_data)
    features = []
    
    for boundary in data["values"]:
        feature_properties = {
            "name": boundary.get("name", ""),
            "type": "Feldweg",
            "source": "Rawdata",
            "date": boundary.get("createdTime", "")
        }
        
        geometry = create_polygon(boundary)
        if geometry:
            feature = Feature(
                type="Feature",
                properties=feature_properties,
                geometry=geometry
            )
            features.append(feature)

    return FeatureCollection(features)

def create_polygon(boundary):
    try:
        outer_ring = []
        for point in boundary["multipolygons"][0]["rings"][0]["points"]:
            lat, lon = point.get("lat"), point.get("lon")
            if lat is not None and lon is not None:
                outer_ring.append((lon, lat))
        
        if len(outer_ring) > 1: # Check that we have at least three points to form a polygon
            return Polygon([outer_ring])
    except (KeyError, IndexError):
        pass

    return None

# Example usage:

json_data = '''
{
 "type": "FeatureCollection",
 "features": [
   {
     "type": "Feature",
     "properties": {
       "name": "ArablebleArea",
       "type": "Feldweg",
       "source": "Rawdata",
       "date": "2021-05-25T11:25:45Z"
     },
     "geometry": {
       "type": "Polygon",
       "coordinates": [
         [
           [10.460348, 51.120577],
           [10.460492, 51.120627],
           [10.460969, 51.120139],
           [10.460819, 51.120081],
           [10.460348, 51.120577]
         ]
       ]
     }
   }
 ]
}
'''

converted_data = convert_to_feature_collection(json_data)
print(converted_data)
```
This module defines a `convert_to_feature_collection` function that takes the JSON data as input and returns an object with the desired schema. It also includes a helper function `create_polygon`, which is used to create a `Polygon` geometry from the provided JSON structure.
To use this module, you can call the `convert_to_feature_collection` function with your JSON data as the argument, like in the example above. The output will be an object that matches the specified schema.

Please note that this implementation assumes that all input JSON files follow a specific format and are well-formed. If your actual JSON data might have variations or inconsistencies, you may need to adjust the code accordingly to handle those cases.
